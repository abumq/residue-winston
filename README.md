For options, please refer to [Residue for Node.js](https://github.com/zuhd-org/residue-node#connectoptions)

Simply enable the transport on winston

```javascript
const Residue = require('residue-winston');
const residue_internal = Residue.residue_internal;

// or import Residue, { residue_internal } from 'residue-winston';

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'silly',
  transports: [
    new Residue({
        logger_id: 'sample-app',
        // following is optional, if config_file not provided
        // all these options are used as config
        config_file: 'path to config file'
    })
  ]
});

console.log(`Residue library version ${residue_internal.version()}-${residue_internal.type()}`);
```

## Use Residue Logger
You can also use mix of winston logger and residue logger when using `residue-winston` module.

```
const rlogger = residue_internal.getLogger('mylogger');
rlogger.info('this is object value: %s', {name: 'Adam', age: 960});
```
